    -GameAlgo

DiGraph
    -All this need to do is have the methods for graphs.
    -Need to recieve a json file and convert the nodes and edges properly.

GraphAlgo
    -The client class has a get_graph that returns a json file.
    -We need to load that json string using the load_from_json method.
